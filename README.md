 Tkinter leave management App

This GitHub project, Leave Management System, is a web application designed to streamline employee leave management within an organization. Built with Django (a Python-based web framework), it enables administrators to create user profiles, manage employee leave requests, and track leave balances. Employees can log in, apply for leave, and view the status of their requests. 

A potential future addition is the integration of blockchain technology to provide an immutable, decentralized record of leave requests and approvals. This would enhance data transparency and security, allowing employees and management to verify records without alteration, potentially addressing issues around data authenticity and auditing.
